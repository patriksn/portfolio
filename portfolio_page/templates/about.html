                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">About Me</h1>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    I'm an engineer with roots in electrical and medical engineering who've realized that my passion is within machine learning and data analysis. I did multiple programming courses at KTH and also did both my bachelor's and master's theses within machine learning. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    My background in electrical engineering has given me a strong foundation in both HW and SW (I tailored my program to include more SW than normal). While I do enjoy vibe coding, I also know what's going on on a deeper level and have a deeper understanding of the programming languages that I know. In my studies I learnt everything from high level languages (python, MATLAB) all the way down to interpreting the 1's and 0's that are sent to the ALU in the CPU, and the software architecture that connects everything in between (e.g. VM code (logic and push/pop commands), stack/heap and I learnt the basics of languages like C/C++).
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    While I recently got the opportunity to try a very interesting role in HW, I've come to realize that my passion is within SW.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    In the future, I would love to work with ML and data analysis/data science and I'm also keen on learning more about deployment/cloud services/devops. I recently made the final decision to transfer into this field and am now spending a lot of my free time studying to refresh and strengthen my skills. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    I am currently learning PostgreSQL, refreshing my skills in Python and TensorFlow and I'm also learning about Docker, Kubernetes and AWS. I'm also competing in Kaggle data science competitions to sharpen my ML skills further.
                </p>
